# Rayman Redemption Flake

I had some issues getting Rayman Redemption working on NixOS because I didn't really know how to use Wine.  Once I figured it out (it wasn't hard) I figured it made sense to make a wrapper flake so I wouldn't have to figure it out again. 

## Instructions

- Make sure you have Flakes enabled. 
 
- Download [Rayman Redemption](https://gamejolt.com/games/raymanredemption/340532). 

- Extract it. 

- Place the `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` from this folder into the extracted Rayman Redemption folder. 

- Run it with `nix run`. 

- Enjoy!
